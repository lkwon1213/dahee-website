            <p>
              Hi â€” I am a software developer and artist currently studying at
              Columbia University.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was born in Seoul, have lived in San Diego, Lawrenceville,
              London, and am currently living in New York.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interests are in web development and more recently, computer
              vision. I have worked on projects that span from front end
              development, UI design, GUI development, and game development.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        {/*<Projects />*/}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Home;
